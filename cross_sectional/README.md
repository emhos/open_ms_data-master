## 3D MR image database of Multiple Sclerosis patients with white matter lesion segmentations



This archive contains Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS) patients with corresponding consensus based ground
truth segmentations of white matter lesions. The images are grouped 
into folders for each of the patients. Each patient's folder consists of:

- Co-registered and bias corrected T1-weighted (T1W), contrast enhanced T1-weighted (T1WKS), T2-weighted (T2W) and FLAIR images (co-registered to FLAIR space)
- Brain mask (in FLAIR space)
- Consensus white matter lesion segmentations (in FLAIR space)
- RAW images in their original space 
- Intra-study transform parameters (rigid to FLAIR)

To preserve patients' privacy **all images have been defaced**. 
For more details please see the *References*.
